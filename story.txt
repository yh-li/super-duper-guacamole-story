Once there was a student Jack majored in the computer science. His friends told him that he needs to take CS400 and he followed the suggestion. All the things seemed usual until one day he was introduced to the Pandora box named GitHub. His life was then changed.

Jack couldn't get over the vast posibilities wiht GitHub. Each day he would delve deeper and deeper into what he could do with this amazing box. He would open it and streams of light would bound out and illuminate the room. But then... One day Jack opened teh box and reached deep inside. He lost his footing and fell in.
